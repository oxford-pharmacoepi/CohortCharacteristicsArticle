#### CohortCharacteristics package

[CohortCharacteristics](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CohortCharacteristics/) is an R package that is used to summarise and visualise the characteristics of patients in data mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) [1]. The package can be found in cran [2], with version 0.4.0 as of December 2024.

The package is build around omopgenerics [3] and PatientProfiles [4]. omopgenerics define classes and methods for a set of packages to query OMOP CDM databases and PatientProfiles is used to identify the characteristics of patients at the patient level.

The main functionality is to characterise cohorts (a cohort is a set of individuals that fulfill some inclusion criteria during a certain time). The data

- Summarise cohort counts.
- Summarise attrition of a cohort.
- Summarise cohort overlap between different cohorts.
- Summarise timing between different cohorts.
- Summarise the demographics and intersections of different cohorts.
- Summarise the concepts recorded
